## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This data set contains information about houses sold in selected cities in Tennessee from 2013 to 2019. Before information was obtained from it, various data cleaning procedures were used to ensure the data was meaningful.
Just like Data Cleaning-1, MySQL Workbench was used.

## DATA CLEANING
The following tasks were performed in this stage:
1. Loading into a schema in MySQL Workbench
2. Removal of duplicates.
3. Standardisation of dates.
4. Handling missing and null values.
5. Removing rows and columns that were considered irrelevant.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This stage involved exploring the data to answer questions such as;
1. In which city were houses mostly bought?
2. In which city were houses least bought??
3. If one was to construct a house for sale, which city would he/she consider?
4. In which year were the houses mostly bought?
5. How many bedroomed houses sold the most?

## FINDINGS
1. Nashville City had the most sales.
2. Mount Juliet had the least sales.
3. 2015 has the year when houses were bought the most and 2019 the least.
And more in the Exploratory Data Analysis.

## LIMITATION
The data may not have been enough. I say this because i cannot believe that 2019 had the least sales, because of factors like increased population
